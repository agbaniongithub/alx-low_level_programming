Hi. This Project is to create dynamic libraries based on past project files we have created. From the resource provided, I learnt that dynamic libraries are better than static libraries because dynamic libraries store object files in a seperate file in memory separate from the executable file. The advantage of this is that unlike static libraries that compile the object with executables, the dynamic library saves memory, and when we want to update our program we don't have ton recompile it because the library file is separate and can easily be updated in the memory before execution. Dynamic library is .dll on windows and .so(shared object) on Linux.
